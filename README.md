**This is not my personal website.**
This website is used for hosting static assets only. My personal website is avaliable at **[vmolik.com](http://vmolik.com/)**, if you are looking for that.


## What is this?
This is a website hosted on GitHub Pages.
I use it to host static assets — such as images — so they can be easily linked elsewhere, for example in my email signature with my school’s logo.
Hosting static content here provides me a free, open-source solution and helps avoid sending extra traffic to my paid VPS, where I run my personal website.

## Am I allowed to use this?
It really depends. I do not own the content in `/imported/`, so you will need to get the original author's permission. Some content in `/owned/` is also licensed, but by me. You will need my permission to use it.

- You are free to use all content in `/owned/` that is not licensed.
- You have to get my permission to use content licensed by me in `/owned/`, unless you actively study or work at SSPŠ.
- I do not own the material in `/imported/`. You must contact the original author for permission to use it.
