# v1.0.0
# Branch: master

### What happened to the old repository?
The old reporitory did not have a good versioning system.
I renamed the old repo to "nymvaclav/nymvaclav.github.io.old" and archived it.
This is being built upon the old repository.

### Will everything stay the same?
No. I will create the following branches:
- master,
- content, and
- grammar
- dev

No commits except this one will be commited to the master branch.
- New articles and projects (content) will be commited into the content branch, then checked for typos and merged into master.
- Grammar branch will be used when I find a typo in an already released article/project. I'll fix it and merge into master.
- Dev branch will be used to fix bugs I find.

Please note I may create additional branches for testing new features, which might be merged into master.

### Understanding the versioning system:
* vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
This meant that this is the first version of this website.

I will follow this versioning when changes from branches will be merged into master:
-MAJOR for breaking changes.
-MINOR for new features/articles/projects.
-PATCH for bug fixes and grammar corrections.
